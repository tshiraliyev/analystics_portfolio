# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

üìå Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn in a bank using SQL and Power BI. The dataset includes customer demographics, financial status, and behavioral indicators to identify factors contributing to churn. The analysis provides insights into how age, credit score, gender, complaints, and satisfaction levels influence customer exit rates.

üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of a table named customers, containing:

CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer

Age: Age of the customer

Gender: Male or Female

CreditScore: Customer's credit score (350-850)

Complain: Whether the customer has filed a complaint (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

Satisfaction_Score: Satisfaction level (1 to 5)

Exited: Whether the customer has left the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

üéØ Hypotheses Tested

Age and Churn: Older customers might have a higher exit rate.

Gender and Churn: Gender may influence customer retention.

Credit Score and Churn: Customers with lower credit scores might churn more.

Complaints and Churn: Customers who file complaints may be more likely to leave.

Satisfaction and Churn: Low satisfaction scores might correlate with higher exit rates.

üìä Power BI: Visualization & Analysis <br>
In Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze bank customer churn. It includes key metrics that help identify patterns among customers who have left the bank.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6158e646-5515-4d61-a6d5-8f481de0e475)


üîπ Dashboard Includes:
üìå Churn Rate by Age Group ‚Äì Identifies which age groups are most likely to leave. <br>
üìå Churn Rate by Satisfaction Score ‚Äì Analyzes the impact of satisfaction levels on retention. <br>
üìå Donut Chart by Card Type ‚Äì Distribution of customers based on card type (Gold, Silver, Platinum, Diamond). <br>
üìå Churn Rate by Geography ‚Äì Examines regional differences in customer retention. <br>
üìå Total Customers Overview ‚Äì A key metric showing the size of the customer base. <br>

üîπ The Power BI dashboard visually confirms the hypotheses identified through SQL analysis and presents the results in a way that is easy for business teams to interpret. üöÄ

üìà Key Findings

Older customers (50+) have the highest churn rate.

Gender does not significantly impact churn.

Customers with lower credit scores tend to leave more often.

Customers who file complaints have a significantly higher exit rate.

Low satisfaction scores strongly correlate with churn.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

SQL for data analysis and querying

Power BI for visualization and reporting

üèÜ Conclusion

By understanding these customer churn patterns, banks can take action to improve customer retention, such as increasing engagement with dissatisfied customers, addressing complaints proactively, and offering better services to high-risk segments.
